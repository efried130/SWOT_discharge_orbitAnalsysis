These data support a manuscript detailing SWOT satellite Version C discharge performance using GRADES constrained priors across on reaches overlapping both the Fast Sampling and Science orbits. 
Four orbit configurations are assessed using four separate Confluence offline runs with differing date inputs: Fast Sampling orbit only ('Fast'), Science Orbit only ('Science'), both orbits ('Continuous'), and the Fast Sampling Orbit sampled to Science orbit frequency ('Sampled'). 
Consensus discharge data after CV filtering as used in analysis is provided here.

The scripts include the functions, figure generation, and analysis to show explore orbit differences in Version C discharge. The discharge data for each Confluence run is located on zenodo at DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18012950.
